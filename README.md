## Problem Solving Guidelines

- **Difficulty Levels**:
  - **Easy**: Simple problems to practice basic concepts.
  - **Medium**: Problems that require a deeper understanding of algorithms and data structures.
  - **Hard**: Challenging problems that combine multiple concepts or require advanced problem-solving techniques.

- **Tags**: Each problem is tagged with the relevant concepts such as Arrays, Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Greedy, etc. This will help you filter problems based on your area of interest or difficulty level.
